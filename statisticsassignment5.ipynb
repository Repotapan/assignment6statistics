    "In hypothesis testing, a Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a false positive error, and it means that the researcher concludes that there is a significant effect or difference when there really isn't. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by the symbol alpha (α), and it is typically set at a pre-determined level (e.g., 0.05).\n",
